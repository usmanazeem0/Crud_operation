Form Validation & CRUD Operations Project
This project demonstrates Form Validation using JavaScript DOM manipulation along with a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system, with data stored in the browser’s localStorage.

✨ Features
Form Validation
Validates user inputs (e.g., name, email, password, etc.) before submission.
Prevents registration if the email is already taken.
Displays real-time error messages for invalid or empty fields.
Ensures clean and correct data entry.


CRUD Operations
Create → Add new records from the form.
Read → Display stored records dynamically on the page.
Update → Edit existing records directly from the list.
Delete → Remove unwanted records.
Unique Email Check → New users cannot register with an email that already exists.


Data Storage
Uses localStorage to save records.
Data persists even after page reload or browser restart.


Technologies Used
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for styling
JavaScript (DOM Manipulation) for validation, CRUD logic, and localStorage
